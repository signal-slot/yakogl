# Handoff

The state of the work and what comes next. Update this file in the same
commit as any result that changes it. Last update: 2026-10-06.

Board addresses, UART paths and credentials never go in this file; they come
from the environment (`BOARD_HOST`, `BOARD_UART`, ...).

## Goal, in order

1. ES 2.0 finished on the three boards (AM62P PowerVR, i.MX8MP GC7000,
   Raspberry Pi 4 V3D), each booted from its own storage by its bootloader.
2. Minimum performance.
3. A public website (`website/`). It goes live when the repository is public.
4. ES 3.1 / 3.2.

## State of main

Results are from main as of `186cbb56`: AM62P gl_test on `05f8f749`, Slint and cluster on `05f8f749` (`7dada1ff` for the fill_color figures), i.MX8MP gc_gl_test on `05f8f749`, the Pi 4 on `afa12e9b`. All three boards boot standalone from eMMC (the two Verdins, U-Boot) or SD (Pi 4).
`docs/standalone-boot.md` has the procedure.

| Board | gl_test | Slint | Cluster |
|---|---|---|---|
| AM62P | 48 / 48, 0 resets (the set now has 192 `predlive`); 48 / 48 in the compiler-only and precompiled + compiler images (`05f8f749`) | pass on `7dada1ff` (705 frames in 10007 ms; also with the precompiled tier, same records, `17605c36`) | 91.8 fps, 56.4 Mpx/s, 16.28 ms/Mpx on `7dada1ff` (also with the precompiled tier, same records, `17605c36`; `39bd6983`: 91.2 fps, 56.0 Mpx/s, 16.11 ms/Mpx) |
| i.MX8MP | 46 / 48 on `72d16864` and `112dd4fb`, first failure case 16 (#8). On `05f8f749`: 44 / 48 (first failure case 2), 45 / 48 (case 2), 46 / 48 (case 16): case 2 is intermittent (#25) | not run | not run |
| Pi 4 | 12 / 12 on `afa12e9b` (not run since) | not run since | not run since |

AM62P, the fill shader from femtovg (`fill_color`), 3D busy per frame:

| Measurement | Run-time compiler `81c53c61` | `39bd6983` | Mesa table (`afa12e9b`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| gl_test case 39, perf 2 (16 full-screen quads) | 77.19 ms | 81.1 ms | 83.4 ms |
| case 186 arm 0 (blend) | 76.98 ms | 80.9 ms | 83.4 ms |
| case 186 arm 1 (nodiscard, blend) | 54.56 ms | 55.3 ms | 54.9 ms |
| case 186 arm 2 (blend off) | 68.93 ms | 69.8 ms | 71.6 ms |
| case 186 arm 3 (nodiscard, blend off) | 44.00 ms | | |
| case 187 arms 0 / 1 / 2 / 3 | 81.02 / 59.05 / 72.52 / 47.94 ms | | |

The table column comes from an earlier image. No table image of `81c53c61`
was run.

Case 193 `offarm` (`7dada1ff`): 186 arm 1 with the never-run arm grown by N
groups, 3D busy per frame (record `20261005-2118-case193-7dada1ff-ad3d86cf`
online, `20261005-2119-case193-table-7dada1ff-ed2efe33` table; pixels equal
at every N):

| Added groups N | Run-time compiler | Table |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 54564 us | 54851 us |
| 8 | 55415 us | 56008 us |
| 32 | 59323 us | 60633 us |
| 128 | 91142 us | 91745 us |

The offline PowerVR table (`tests/reference/blobs.rs`) records, since `0fe778f6`,
the toolchain that reproduces it byte for byte: a `pco_shc` built by
`tools/pco_shc/build_pco_shc.sh` with the patched usclib
(`// toolchain: pco_shc=f537fc86b41f glslang=9e007f4bf514`). That commit also
adds `matattr`'s 20 rows and re-keys `texsize.frag` to its current text.
On the AM62P (`60ffeec8`, table image) the regression set passes 39 / 40,
0 resets; the one failure is case 48 `es3vol`, which was already failing in
table images. Case 46 `es3size` (it uses `texsize.frag`) passes now; it was
refused before the re-key. Case 63 `matattr` passes, served from the table
for the first time.
The GC7000 table still lags on `matattr`: issue #22, not fixed by `0fe778f6`.
Since `84b5761e` no product image links a Mesa-built row: the reference lives
in `tests/reference/` for the host gate, and the measurement table image opts
in with `mesa-reference-table`. An image can now carry its app's shaders
precompiled by our compiler (feature `precompiled-shaders`, Kconfig
`YAKOGL_PRECOMPILED_SHADERS` and `_APPS`) in front of the compiler.

A never-run arm of a predicated `if` still costs time (gl_test 193, 194 on the
AM62P): 0.11 ms a group for a small arm, rising to 0.38 ms a group beyond
about 128 groups (an executed group is about 0.79 ms). A branch has a fixed
cost of 5336 us a frame, about 6.8 executed groups (195). The default lowering
(`select::branch_pays`, `5f4d3677`, board-proved: gl_test 48 / 48, record
`20261006-0403-gt-5f4d3677-ecce9b75`) branches an `if` iff the masked cost of
each arm exceeds that fixed cost, which is crossed at 49 groups an arm; 0 of
168 corpus `if`s branch, and `fill_color` (31 / 23 groups) stays predicated.
`PVR_BACKEND_OPT_IF_LOWERING` PREDICATE and BRANCH force a form. If a real
shader ever shows a large arm under a uniform condition, the step is a per-draw
variant chosen by the GL core from the condition's value (predicated when the
long arm runs, branched when it is skipped; `fill_color` at N = 128 would go
from 91.1 to 55.3 ms with the arm off); it is not planned now.

## Open work, in order

1. **Compile shaders at build time with our own compiler.** Shaders known
   at build time are compiled then; the run-time compiler runs only on a
   miss. An image without the run-time compiler refuses a miss by name.
   Mesa's `pco_shc` / `etna_shc` then compile nothing.
   Done, in this order: `68563f54` the one source list every table generator
   reads (`tools/shaders/precompiled.list`) and `yakogl-precompile`, which
   compiles it with our compiler on the host (tools/README.md); `dea95deb`
   the Mesa reference leaves product code (`tests/reference/`,
   `shaderc::mesa_reference`; a product links it only as a measurement
   image's table, `mesa-reference-table`, Kconfig `YAKOGL_SHADERC_OFFLINE`);
   `84b5761e` the compiler is the default back end in Kconfig and CMake
   (only `baremetal.mk` still takes the reference: its OSAL lends the
   compiler no region); `17605c36` the precompiled tier in front of the
   compiler (feature `precompiled-shaders`, Kconfig
   `YAKOGL_PRECOMPILED_SHADERS` and `_APPS`: the table looked up by the
   compiler's record key before any compile, a hit running none), with
   `17e7d34c` the image without a compiler (`YAKOGL_SHADERC_PRECOMPILED_ONLY`:
   a miss, a variant or a program the table lacks is refused by name,
   -ENOENT; gl_test's closing line counts precompiled hits and compiler
   runs); `05f8f749` the back ends' own programs from our compiler (the
   PowerVR's frame-load, masked-clear and clear-attach programs, the
   GC7000's clear pair: the list's `internal` lines, `yakogl-precompile
   --internal` into `src/pvr/internal.rs` / `src/vivante/internal.rs`).
   Board proof on the AM62P (`05f8f749`): gl_test 48 / 48 compiler-only
   (hits 0, compiler runs 197) and precompiled + compiler (hits 111, runs
   65); the image without a compiler 40 / 48 (cases 181, 182, 183, 188 to
   192 refused by name, hits 111, runs 0); Slint and the cluster keep their
   records, cluster 91.8 fps. Earlier: the tier on `17605c36` with
   `gl_test_es100`'s 1291 rows, 48 / 48; Slint and the cluster with
   `femtovg`'s 583 rows, same pictures.
   Parked: branch `work/pco-driver-programs` (`f5e4aa57`): the driver's five
   end-of-tile programs, the boot self-test's vertex shader and the
   VDM-sync program come from our encoder, byte-identical to pco's, so pco
   compiles nothing for a product image. The full gate passed before a
   HANDOFF amend. It needs a rebase onto origin/main and a `--quick` run,
   then landing and an AM62P gl_test, Slint and cluster board run.
   Open points: the list's gl_test app misses the inline shader sources of
   cases 181, 182, 183 and 188 to 192 (`tools/precompile/gl_test_pairs.py`
   does not follow the measurement cases' inline tables); sampler-state
   (lod-key) variants are not precompiled (`gl_test_es100/texture.frag has
   no variant for sampler key 0x1`; the draw takes the base program);
   `YAKOGL_PRECOMPILED_SHADERS` is still off by default.
   Remaining steps: 6 the default turns on (after the points above); 7
   rename to "precompiled shaders" and "shader compiler" (features
   `precompiled-shaders` and `shader-compiler` for `shaderc-online` and
   `shaderc-offline`; Kconfig symbols, the C ABI, log prefixes); 8 the
   source moves from `src/shaderc/online` to `src/shaderc/compiler` and
   `docs/online-shaderc` to `docs/shader-compiler`; 9 optionally, V3D rows.
   The words online, offline and remote go away.
2. **Design clean-up.** Decided 2026-10-06; the measured inventory is in
   parentheses.
   - Done: clean-up 1 (`260711b9`, the GC7000's debug statics: 4 removed, 5
     hard-coded at the default every image ran, 3 with their C entry points
     behind the new `test-knobs` feature, `CONFIG_YAKOGL_TEST_KNOBS`;
     product archive `gc_debug_*`/`gc_perf_*` symbols 32 -> 8) and clean-up
     2 (`72d16864`, `mrt`, `vs_tiled`, `int_filter` and `desc_seq` become
     the design, the narrow L8/A8/LA8 store on by default; the product
     archive defines no `gc_debug_*` symbol). Board, i.MX8MP gc_gl_test:
     `260711b9` 45 / 48 (first failure case 10, #9), `gc_gl_triangle` byte
     identical to `84b5761e`; `72d16864` 46 / 48 (first failure case 16,
     #8), with MRT on cases 106 `mrt3` and 163 `drawbuf0` run. dEQP on
     `72d16864`: 10 of 12 rows identical to the 29460f96 baseline; two
     regressions, `fbo.completeness.renderable.renderbuffer.depth.
     depth_component24` and `shaders.fragdata.*` (indexed `gl_FragData[]`
     write refused).
   - Awaiting the gate and landing, branch `work/cleanup-1-vivante-knobs`:
     clean-up 3 (the PowerVR's switches leave the product: 5 hard-coded at
     their measured defaults, 2 switches and 8 options behind test-knobs, 5
     options retired; no image changes behaviour) and the two dEQP fixes (an
     ES 2.0 surface refuses a DEPTH_COMPONENT24 renderbuffer and has no
     GL_MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS / GL_DRAW_BUFFERi query).
   - Order from here (4 to 15): GL core / V3D knobs; the driver Kconfig
     instruments; samples cut; gl_test Rust harness; (after the shader-compiler
     rename, item 1) compiler knobs; samples stage 2; bare metal; names;
     OSALs to Rust; docs. Clean-up 1 to 3 are the Vivante and PowerVR knobs.
   - Globals: about 59 debug and experiment knobs (32 `static mut`, 16
     `PVR_BACKEND_OPT_*` slots, 11 others). Only `IF_LOWERING` and
     `ONE_IN_FLIGHT` stay product options. The measurement infrastructure
     (draw-step timing, `CHECK_RUN`, 3D-busy accounting) stays.
   - Samples: 22 today -> triangle, gl_test (one sample, merged across the
     GPUs), slint, cluster, deqp, plus glmark2 for measurement.
   - Bare metal is made true, not removed. `src/osal/baremetal.c` is a
     skeleton with three `TODO(board)`. It must lend the compiler its
     scratch and keep regions as `zephyr_shaderc_scratch.c` does; the
     application must provide the documented 256 KiB compile stack; a board
     layer is needed (firmware boot, GPU MMU, cache maintenance, IRQ-less
     waits); the gate must build `baremetal.mk`; one board boot must be
     recorded. Today no gate row runs `baremetal.mk` and
     `tools/cts/RESULTS.md` has no bare-metal boot. Design first, after the
     rename.
   - Names: `SAFEUI_*` -> `YAKOGL_DRV_*` (652 occurrences in 119 files, 48
     Kconfig symbols), including the cross-core protocol names shared with
     the M7 (`SAFEUI_FRAME_RING_*`, `SAFEUI_M7_PAGE_*`, `SAFEUI_LAYOUT_DIR`,
     `samples/zephyr/safeui/`); `safeui,*` DT compatibles -> `yakogl,*`;
     module `powervr-bxs` -> `yakogl-drivers`; `PVR_SAMPLE_*` ->
     `YAKOGL_SAMPLE_*`. The external `slint-safe-ui-zephyr` references stay.
   - Docs: the plans and bring-up diaries in `driver/docs` and
     `docs/direct-boot.md` move to `tools/cts/log/` (the 35 code references
     are updated in the same commits); `docs/` and `driver/docs` then
     describe only the current design.
   - Remaining C moves to Rust: the OSALs (3,740 lines), `gl_test.c` (20,291
     lines: a Rust runner calls the C cases through `extern "C"`, ported in
     batches), `driver/src` (about 16k lines).
3. **Known defects.** Each has a GitHub issue; what remains is the fixes:
   - i.MX8MP gl_test case 10 fails about 1 run in 3 (nondeterminism; the
     cause is not found) (#9);
   - i.MX8MP case 16 (4x MSAA) fails (#8);
   - i.MX8MP gl_test case 2 (`texture`) fails intermittently since
     `05f8f749` (2 of 3 runs: 44 / 48 and 45 / 48 with case 2 first, 46 / 48
     with case 16 first; `112dd4fb`, without commits 4 and 5, 46 / 48) (#25).
     The command streams of 24 `cs_ours` modes are byte-identical between
     `72d16864` and `05f8f749` and the two images differ only in
     `record_key`, `gl_test_run` and the clear tables, so it is the
     nondeterminism class of #9, not a deterministic regression;
   - the Pi 4 differs from the ES 2.0 reference in 25 cube cases (#12);
   - the i.MX8MP panel showed one and a half copies of the frame per line at
     the 71.1 MHz pixel clock (no DSI margin); the device tree is back at
     69.3 MHz and the margin is a checked limit (`e372545f`); the DISPLAY
     record on `c1f0e2a6` shows the link at 69.3 MHz (lane rate 426600 kHz,
     headroom 25.9 per mille, bridge IRQ_STAT clean, health 0x3f); the
     viewing by eye is still pending (#23).

## How to work here

- The records prove the framebuffer, not the panel: a display change needs
  someone looking at the panel (#23).
- The gate is `tools/check.sh`. Run it from a clean detached checkout of
  the exact commit, with `driver/src/fw/pvr_fw_blob.h` copied in, and with
  `ZEPHYR_WS=<west workspace>` and `HAL_NXP_DIR=<hal_nxp>` set. Without
  them the Zephyr and hal_nxp rows are gaps and the gate is red. The
  Mesa-table reproduction row also needs `PCO_SHC=<pco_shc from
  tools/pco_shc/build_pco_shc.sh, content id f537fc86b41f>`,
  `GLSLANG=<glslangValidator>` and, for speed, `GLSL2USC_CACHE=<dir>`;
  without them that row is a gap and the gate is red. It takes about 45
  minutes.
- Board runs use `tools/board.sh <board> run <zephyr.bin> <record dir>
  <label>`. Run them from a detached checkout of main, and only with images
  built from commits on origin/main. Use `BOARD_BOOT=uboot-mmc` on the
  Verdins.
- A dEQP image bakes its table in: splitting rows needs a rebuilt image
  (`tools/cts/imx8mp-deqp-build.sh --table`; tools/cts/README.md).
- One GL client per board. Check that a board is idle before you use it.
